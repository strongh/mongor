h1. mongor

A pure R driver for MongoDB. Mongor is still in its infancy, but already supports basic operations including 

* inertions, 
* queries, 
* updates, 
* deletes, and 
* executing database commands.

MongoDB offers many more advanced features. 


h2. Getting Started

You'll need a couple of things to use mongor.

*# get "MongoDB installed & running":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart
*# the "rbson":https://github.com/strongh/rbson/ library

A teaser session (to convince the reader that at least some of the package works at all):

pre. 
> myDocument <- list(mongo="R-friendly!") # R lists are the equivalent of Mongo's documents
> mc <- mongoConnect() # Opens a connection to a Mongo server, with localhost as the default
> mongoInsert(mc, myDocument) 
> mongoFind(mc, list(mongo=list("$exists"=TRUE))) # the list is a query document

All of the basic message types have been implemented; I'm still working on how best to expose Mongo's services to R users. Any input is appreciated!
