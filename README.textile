h1. mongor

A pure R driver for MongoDB.

h2. Getting Started

You'll need a couple of things to use mongor.

*# get MongoDB installed & running
*# the "rbson":https://github.com/strongh/rbson/ library

A sample session:

pre. 
myDocument <- list(mongo="R-friendly!")
mc <- mongoConnect()
mongoInsert(mc, myDocument)
mongoFind(mc, list(mongo=list("$exists"=TRUE)))

All of the basic message types have been implemented; I'm still working on how best to expose Mongo's services to R users. Any input is appreciated!
